<h2 id=introduction><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p>In 1973, Ferreri‚Äôs La Grande Bouffe was officially screened at the Cannes Film Festival where it
stirred great outrage (Taillibert, 2002). Instantly after its projection, the film placed itself in a
tradition of controversial movies that transcend from their initial shock value into debate and
deliberation for decades to come.
Many questions come to mind when viewing Ferreri‚Äôs La Grande Bouffe; is it a jab at the
debauchery of the bourgeoisie? Is there any deeper meaning to this spectacle of vomit and
excrement? Or, is it a mere dark comedy with cheap overused gags?
Without doubt, La Grande Bouffe is a confusing experience for the watcher.</p>

<p>Through this article, I investigate La Grande Bouffe philosophically. As I engage on the task,
I will touch on three main sections: (I) the first is a reconstruction of movie‚Äôs plot along with
its criticism, (II) the second and more substantial will be a discussion of the movie‚Äôs
transgression, subversion and desecration of philosophical elements, (III) and finally the third
section joins my conclusion on the movie and argumentation on its heightened philosophical
significance over a sociological one.</p>

<p>Despite their contrasting differences, the four characters have some commonalities. They all are
keeping their escapade secret, and they all carry gifts into their mission.
Ugo bears his culinary expertise, jars and knives, Michel brings cleaning utilities, Marcello imports cheese and packed
goods, and finally Philippe offers the setting for the rest of the movie: a manor in the chicest
district of Paris, in the street Boileau.</p>
<p>After being welcomed into the manor by Hector, an elderly handyman, their first day is marked
by a visit from a Chinese ambassador convoying purchasing the mansion, excessively grandiose
meat and vegetable deliveries, and long preparations. Both Michel and Marcello interact with
statuettes of women; Michel dusts then whips one with his glove inside the manor, while
Marcello caresses perversely a statue in the garden. At dinner time, oysters are devoured at a
frenetic pace by the four protagonists while they observe nude photography of young women.
Ironically, Michel irritated and uncomfortable at the nudity points out: &ldquo;We are not here to have a villainous orgy&rdquo;.</p>
<p>On the second day, Marcello expresses that he cannot only content himself with food: he needs
women, and for one thing: having sex. Soon, a charming bubbly institutor Andrea invites herself
along with her class to see the linden tree of Boileau, and then gets treated to delicious food.
Immediately, she catches the Judge‚Äôs eye and she is invited for dinner with the four friends and
three other eager sex workers. The dinner party is a debacle of food, nudity and sex, where
Andrea reveals herself to be quite promiscuous. Michel lapidates a prostitute‚Äôs body with food
while proclaiming repetitively: &ldquo;The female body is a vanity&rdquo;. Philippe announces his
engagement to Andrea.</p>
<p>Eventually, the prostitutes forfeit one by one, expressing their disgust at the alimentary excesses
of their hosts &ldquo;Do things other than eat, eat, always eat&rdquo;. Michel starts to suffer
from congestion gas pains, but still is pressured to keep eating by his friends. Philippe
encourages him: &ldquo;It is a question of will&rdquo;, while Ugo reminds him of their now evident
suicide pact: ‚ÄúEat again my little Michel, eat. If you don&rsquo;t eat, you won&rsquo;t pass away.".</p>
<p>Andrea chooses to stay; stating so with an eerie expression on her face. In the following scene,
she yells &ldquo;I&rsquo;m hungry!!&rdquo; which prompts the four friends right back on track. The feast ensues,
while their bodies start to break down; Michel is pained by violent flatulence, Ugo‚Äôs face is
rosaceous and Marcello becomes impotent.</p>
<p>In a moment of tension, Marcello breaks the fourth wall: ‚ÄúThere is no fantasy in this story, they chose the crudest way to die‚Äù,
after which ultimately, with all the impetus of a crescendo, the toilets explode.
Later on in bed with his friends, Ugo proclaims: ‚ÄúThe smell of shit will never leave us‚Äù, to which Michel answers: &ldquo;The Universal Flood&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Still covered in fecal matter, Marcello tries to leave, only to be found dead behind the wheel of
his beloved Bugatti. Michel follows and dies from an indigestion, Ugo gorges himself to death
on his best creation. Philippe succumbs to his diabetes after eating breast shaped flans. Each of
the four characters dies without dignity, nor the mercifulness of a proper burial.
The final meat delivery ends up being useless, excessive and is plainly wasted: thrown by the
butchers for the dogs to enjoy, while Andrea sorrowfully goes back to the manor.</p>

<h3 id=critique><strong>Critique</strong></h3>
<h4 id=critic-1-jordan-white><em><strong>Critic 1: Jordan White</strong></em></h4>
<p>According to a critic in DVD classic by Jordan White, a forum for movie‚Äô analysis and critics,
‚ÄúLa Grande Bouffe‚Äù is more than a simple comedy as it touches on passion, boredom, the midlife
crisis of the forties and loneliness. Ferreri flips off the sanctimonious by paving the way for
movies as iconic and as cult to be debated positively and negatively. White states that Marco
Ferreri‚Äôs masterpiece makes us chuckle by its comedic pitch, by the actor‚Äôs investiture and
dedication, but also by its ability to make us think (White, 2006).</p>
<h4 id=critic-2-taillibert><em><strong>Critic 2: Taillibert</strong></em></h4>
<p>In Taillibert‚Äôs cinematic review, she theorizes that a serious diabetes crisis might have been a
potential source for Ferreri‚Äôs cinematographic inspiration. However, she also finds that that the
vices and weaknesses of the bourgeoisie had caught Ferreri‚Äôs attention and alternately led his wrath
against the insolent opulence of capitalist societies, collective alienations, the Catholic
Church, money and power; in which Ferreri‚Äôs cinematographic revolt was ultimately
accomplished through food and sex, two elements that society places at the top ladder of pleasure.
Tallibert also discusses the newsroom‚Äôs reaction and inexhaustible surge of insults for the
filmmaker. For some, it&rsquo;s the vulgarity of the film that is in cause, others reproached him the
nihilistic foundations by putting forth humanistic values, while others hid behind the religious
values of Christian morality. She concludes by stating that film‚Äôs like La Grande Bouffe are,
after all, excellent tools to dissect the vices of modern society; quoting Michel Piccoli‚Äôs
interview with Serge Toubiania on La Grande Bouffe in a special supplement of the Cahiers du
cinema : ¬´ (‚Ä¶) comme si Marco nous ouvrait et nous montrait notre cancer ¬ª (Taillibert, 2002).</p>
<h4 id=critic-3-christine-lahaie><em><strong>Critic 3: Christine Lahaie</strong></em></h4>
<p>In the article ¬´ De Quelques Films Culinaires ¬ª by Christiane Lahaie, she states that ‚ÄúLa Grande
Bouffe‚Äù makes us reconcile with our nature as omnivores. Marco Ferrerri initiated a starter for a
succession of movies in which consumption of food create the dramatic note like ‚ÄúLe Cuisinier,
le voleur, Sa Femme et son Amant‚Äù by Peter Greenway. But none will ever attain the same level
of abjection by linking food and death. However, she finds that the movie betrays misogynistic
ideals through the character of Andrea as a helper of death and desire, and that is unaffected by
an incessant gluttonous gurgitation of food. Lahaie sees La Grande Bouffe‚Äôs feasting as a
catalyser of a deviant sexuality where food is a compensator for the repression of religion, fear of
others and self-narcissism. (Lahaie, 2002)</p>

<figcaption>Andrea, the symbolism of Transgression, Subversion and Desecration</figcaption>
</figure></p>
<p>In the movie, the four friends behaved in an opposite manner of what the
ancient philosopher, Plato, commends.
Plato&rsquo;s philosophy consists of the belief that the world is a reflection of a truer reality, and that in order to philosophize
freely and attain knowledge, humans need to get rid of distraction and distortions.
There are three main prohibited distractions that are encouraged in the movie: excess and gluttony, sex and art.</p>
<p>The characters subvert and transgress those elements: bodily pleasures, food and art are used as a distraction.
They exceed the necessity and at some point; they affect the characters talents and
diminishes their capacity to operate.
An example of that is Ugo, an acclaimed the chef, who progressively gets worse at cooking or Michel who at first plays the piano smoothly and then
gradually becomes worse by forgetting notes and so.
Additionally, Plato considers art as speaking more to the heart than the mind and that it always is a copy of a copy.
He also criticizes all types of corporeal pleasures if not attained through love as a stairway to observe beauty.
The mansion was full of statues and representations: Marcello gropes perversely the statue in the garden and also uses an object to excite the blonde prostitute. In a way, the narrative of the movie is a subversion of Plato‚Äôs philosophy that considers the body and its pleasures as impediments from intellectual freedoms.</p>
<p>Cynic philosophy sees the good life as achieved by following nature: pursuing natural instinct,
manifested in simplicity, before social conventions and obligations. La Grande Bouffe desecrates
that teaching by following natural instincts by using excesses birthed through modernism,
conventions and obligations: the eccentricities and sophistication of the food, the decor and the
prostitutes. As for Rousseau, he described meat-eating as one of the cruelties of the modern
times, this idea can be seen as desecrated in the movie because the characters are overconsuming
all kinds of meat and in the end the carcasses of animals are thrown to be eaten by animals:
Rousseau considers meat-eating as ‚Äúanimals eating animals‚Äù. He prescribes eating normal food
and vegetables and he claims that ‚Äúeverything that is beyond necessity is a source of evil‚Äù.
Schopenhauer claims that there is a fourth way to be liberated from the will which is death by
suicide, but isn‚Äôt a solution to act on it because it is considered as a trick of the will since we are
wishing for a better life and end of misery, and since we are no longer alive to ‚ÄúEnjoy the Show‚Äù
unless death comes from slow starvation which is not considered a force of the will.
The characters subvert that teaching by doing the opposite of what Schopenhauer claims: instead they
eat themselves to death, which is not acceptable by him because they still ‚Äúwill to die‚Äù and
haven‚Äôt lost their will as they would have in self-starvation from an extreme ascetic life.
Schopenhauer also compares the will-of-life to music; Michel‚Äôs deteriorating musical capacities
might metaphorically be a way of showing the mortification of the will.</p>
<p>Epicurean philosophy encourages a materialistic view of pain which sees it is not a thing to fear:
major pain brings death and therefore deliverance from it, and generally encourages intellectual
pleasures after the pleasures of needs fulfilled, and generally favors the natural and necessary
pleasures over the non-natural and non-necessary ones. The latter is desecrated in the movie as
the protagonists indulge in natural and the necessary pleasures and needs to an extreme beyond
necessity and nature: gluttony and lechery. Lucretius conceptualizes sex and food as both
fulfilling, but food will always surpass sex as it can be absorbed by our bodies and therefore is
definitively more satisfying. This teaching is respected by the majority of the characters for the
most part, except for a few transgressions made by Marcello and Andrea who equally seek food
and sex and hold them to the same footing. It was Marcello‚Äôs idea to invite the prostitutes,
because the satisfaction of food is not enough and fulfilling enough for him, he needs sex too.
Ultimately, his breaking point is also directly related to him becoming impotent.</p>
<h2 id=section-iii-general-conclusion><strong>Section III: General Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>To conclude, my verdict on La Grande Bouffe is that as preposterous and vulgar it might be: it
is purposeful in, at the very least, reflecting the philosophical absurdity of human nature.</p>
<p>The movie can be observed as a fable about desires. But, of no fable was it more rightfully said:
it is unique in its linkage between death and desire. In its era, La Grande Bouffe dealt with a
specific desire that almost no film director had ever dared to approach before; the desire of humans to
die. The death drive, as originally coined by Sabrina Spielrein in 1912 and later expanded on in
Freudian psychanalysis, is defined as the inclination of humans towards death and self-destruction (Spielrein, 1995).</p>

</figure></p>
<p>For Sigmund Freud, the death drive, Thanatos, is the antithesis of Eros, which is construed as the impulse
towards sex and survivalist instincts. Freud theorizes that all living beings have a desire or an instinct towards death (Cherry, 2019).
From a philosophical standpoint, the concept of the death drive aligns with Schopenhauer‚Äôs view of life‚Äôs aim as death,
as he considers existence itself as a continuum of dying and that completion is attained through it
(Encyclopedia of Death and Dying, n.d.).</p>
<p>Although in my opinion, <strong>sex and death can work as reciprocals rather than opposites</strong>. Both are
uncomfortable and difficult to talk about. It is common to live in denial of death, just as it is to
live in denial of our sexual desires. It takes ‚Äòliberation‚Äô to be open about sex, and ‚Äòguts‚Äô to accept
death. Perhaps, to incite liberation by gutting the viewer is one of the purposes of Ferreri‚Äôs
masterpiece.
Sex and death are reciprocal reminders of our animalistic nature.
Despite our efforts for distinction and sophistication or our inflated pride about human intellect; we remain animals regulated by the forces of nature.
La Grande Bouffe is emblematic in admonishing the audience of that by celebrating of the body being reduced to its most animalistic functions:
defecating, urinating, copulating, eating, gaging, regurgitating, inflating and dying (Celluloid
Liberation Front, 2014). Over and over in the movie, the audience can pick up on those reminders.
Marcello, the eccentric fashionable aviator, is hung in the freezer with beef carcasses, just like Michel.
Ugo passes on the counter of the kitchen; his cadaver posed as the final piece-de-resistance of his cuisine.
After being served dessert, the judge‚Äôs corpse is left amongst the meat in the garden.</p>
<p>Their humanity is reduced to physiology, with their bodies typified as the flesh of animals; meat they gorged themselves upon.</p>
<p>Marco Ferreri used provocation as a dynamic to represent a life without challenge and where all
pleasures are attained; the life of the bourgeois. Our bourgeois protagonists lead a painstakingly
monotone and boring life until they decide to end their lives: ironically, with too much appetite
for life.
Throughout the movie, it is hinted that our main four characters want to die until they blatantly admit to their suicide pact.
They do not kill themselves pro-actively, but rather seek it passively as a result of their destructive overindulgence.
The protagonists want to blissfully eat themselves to death. Ultimately, their pursuit of death is sought by what regulates life: food.
Lack of food, just as excess of food, leads to suffering and death.</p>
<p>Andrea‚Äôs character assembles both food and sex. She is the insatiable metaphorical ogress of La Grande Bouffe‚Äôs fable; the
young woman opens herself to a universe she didn‚Äôt think she was able to make hers, and thus
liberates herself to unleash her insatiable appetite for lechery and gluttony. Andrea also becomes
as sort of anti-mother; she offers the maternal tenderness by being kind and infantilizing the
names of the four protagonists, but she is not a mother that births, rather than that she is a mother
that guides them to death. Thus, the symbolization of the drive of death, sex and food is taken to
its extreme to serve us, the audience; <strong>a feast of gluttony, desire and sex</strong>.</p>
<p>The heightened philosophical importance of the movie over its sociological one is evident in that
symbolization. The movie has some sociological facets: it openly scandalizes a consumerist
elitist bourgeois class, perhaps on the basis of received ideas and stereotypes on the bourgeoisie
in its time. Yet observing it only as primarily sociological limits its range: it targets only a
stereotyped bourgeois class and their pursuit of death can be just passed as an extravagance and
indulgence. On the other hand, accosting La Grande Bouffe as a philosophical movie is much
more interesting; it gains much more meaning as it can relate, more broadly, to the philosophy of
human nature, the meaninglessness of life, the pursuit of pleasure, absurdism and of most
relevantly to our class: food.</p>
<p>Finally, it is important to point out La Grande Bouffe has pushed audiences and critics to search
for meaning in its meaninglessness as if to make an absurdist point; a majority of secondary
characters and events seem to have no plot relevancy to the story or the character development,
yet these characters and those events simply exist.</p>
