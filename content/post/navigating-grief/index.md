My father passed away. 

And grief became a fever dream where I got to relive all my lost innocence. From shutting the door of the fridge to the smallest possible crease to see when the light would turn off. To the childish game of only stepping in the lithe figure of his shadow… To hearing the clinks of his keys before the door would even open. 

I was a tower, a solid structure, built on the crumbling ground. I am no longer myself. I rarely ever say what I really think I just choose the most fun interactions. I say things I don’t mean, and I always chase distractions. Inconsequently, going from one long string of bad decisions to another.

Maybe dad would’ve said that when it rains, you set up your barrels and when it winds, you start your turbines. My dad would’ve said to be my own boss.

But his death was just insurmountable. I suffered through it. From the moment he fell into a coma, to the last time I hugged him, a corpse. 

Grief is seeing a recipe for mashed potatoes and bawling my eyes because the last time that I made them for him, they weren’t just like he liked them.

Grief is guilt and loss and pain and missing him like a little kid.

Grief feels like being a little girl again and anxiously waiting for him to come back from work so that he could pick me up in his arms.

Grief is all the times he was proud of me and disappointed by me balled up into one unbearable feeling.

Grief is me being irrational, delusional, and heartbroken more than I ever was.

And grief is desolation because there is no way of seeing you or talking to you and it feels like you only exist behind me and I’m only getting further ahead.

Grief is not knowing if I miss you more than I love you or if I love you more than I miss you.
